## Overview

### The Project

‚ÄûBankist 1‚Äù stands for minimalist banking and presents an online bank interface consisting of a welcome message, an overall balance of the account, some summary data, and a history of deposits and withdrawals. The user has three options to perform: transferring money, requesting money, and closing the account. The app requires the user to log in (Read the 'Instructions' below.).

### Instructions:
